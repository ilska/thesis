# thesis code

this github contains the data & src for action classification over 3 databases

it is going to be updated and organized as soon as I work on it

Steps to be performed:

* extract the action files from the original data
* compute DTW per action
* extract fourier pyramid decomposition
* classify DTW and DTW + Fourier
* analyse the results
